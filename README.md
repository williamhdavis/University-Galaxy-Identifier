# University - Galaxy Identifier
A project from my third year at university as part of a computer vision module. This assignment required the identification of galaxy types (spiral and eclipse) from each other. The results of the true positive identifications and the false positive identifications were then compared to a provided solution to determine the effectiveness of the algorithm used.

#### Dependencies
This project requires Python with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

#### Images
The images included with this project is a subset of the images provided by the university for this project. They are included solely to aid the understanding of the codes function.
